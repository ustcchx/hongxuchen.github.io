I’m a junior student from School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC). My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology.   
My research interests involve machine learning, deep learning and its application. I'm currently working in the [LUNA](luna.bdaa.pro) team at USTC as an undergraduate student.
