I’m a senior student from **the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (中科大少年班学院)**. My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology.   
  
My research interests lie in **model editing** and **efficient transfer learning**, with an emphasis on **parameter efficiency** and **memory efficiency**. I am currently an undergraduate student at USTC, working under the guidance of [Prof. Zhenya Huang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huangzhy/). Additionally, I had a six-month research internship with the [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) at HKUST, under the mentorship of [Prof. Long Chen](https://zjuchenlong.github.io/). I am also working closely with [Dr. Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eQ-G_bQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Runshi Li](https://github.com/stflrs).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my projects or anything else.

It is extremely excited to announce that I am going to stay in our [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) at HKUST for my future PHD career!
