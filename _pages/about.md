I’m a senior student from the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (中科大少年班学院). My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology.   
  
My research interests involve **multi-modal learning**, **efficient transfer tuning** (**parameter-efficient & memory-efficient**). I am a member of [LUNA](https://luna.bdaa.pro) team at USTC as an undergraduate student. Currently I am carrying out a six-month summer research internship in [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) at HKUST.   

I really enjoy Hugging Face and often publish some interesting fine-tuned models or datasets. Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.
