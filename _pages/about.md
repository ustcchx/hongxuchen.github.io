I’m a senior student from the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (中科大少年班学院). My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology.   
  
My research interests lie in **model editing** and **efficient transfer learning**, with an emphasis on **parameter efficiency** and **memory efficiency**. I am currently an undergraduate student at USTC, working under the guidance of [Prof. Zhenya Huang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huangzhy/). Additionally, I had a six-month research internship with the [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) at HKUST, under the mentorship of [Prof. Long Chen](https://zjuchenlong.github.io/). 

I really enjoy Hugging Face and often publish some interesting fine-tuned models or datasets. Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.

It is extremely excited to announce that I am going to stay in our [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) at HKUST for my future PHD career!
